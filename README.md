## Food Truck Project

### Description

This project is a food truck rating application that asks the user to input
the names for up to five food trucks, what kind of food each truck serves, and
the user rating for each truck. Once the inputs are complete, the user can
view the list of food trucks with all of their relevant information, the average
rating for the food trucks, and the highest rated food truck.


### Topics and Technologies Used

Technologies used in this program:
* Multiple objects and methods
* Arrays
* Loops (for, for each and while)
* Static vs. non-static fields
* Casting and parsing data types
* Conditionals (if/else and switches)
* Keyboard inputs


### How to Run

Run the application. The user will be prompted to enter in the name, food type,
and rating for food trucks up to a total of five trucks. If the user wants to
type in less than five trucks the user can type "quit" instead of a truck name
and the program will continue.

After truck data is entered, the user will be prompted with a menu to display
the truck data. They can select to either view a list of all truck data, view
the average rating of the food trucks, or view the highest rated food truck.
After each selection the user will be returned back to the menu until they
select the quit option from the menu.

### Lessons Learned

For this project I really focused on the design phase of the project rather than
hacking like I have done with the previous labs/projects. I took the problem
statement and copied it into a comment, then broke the comment  up into steps
with method names for each step. By the time I went to type my code, I just
needed to fill in the method based on what the comment said which was extremely
useful. 

Where I would say I could've improved, however, was to take it one step further
and include the method inputs/outputs (like a UML diagram). There were times
where I had to rewrite my code because I didn't account for the objects I'd need
to pass in or get out of a method (this happened particularly where I was
calling another method within a method and the nested method needed different
inputs). While it really didn't take much time to fix it in a small project like
this, I can imagine in a large project this could be a time consuming mistake.
